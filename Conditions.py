# Python uses boolean logic to evaluate conditions. The boolean values True and False are returned when an expression is compared or evaluated
x =2
print(x == 2) # prints out True
print(x == 3) # prints out False
print(x < 3) # prints out True

# assignment is with '=' and comparison is with '==' (eqaul to) or '!=' (not equal to)
